                    <p>Microsoft HoloLens are a pair of mixed reality smartglasses developed and manufactured by Microsoft. HoloLens was the first head-mounted display running the 
                        Windows Mixed Reality platform under the Windows 10 computer operating system. The glasses come with a 2k see-through screen which can display software such 
                        as a Holographic version of the Windows operating system, 3D Model Viewer, and Microsoft Edge. It has 3GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, and is controlled through
                        hand gestures. There are currently 342 apps compatible with HoloLens, ranging from games to langauge learning tools.

                        The only place to buy Microsoft HoloLens is on the Microsoft store, and they come at a whopping $4,749 CAD. Due to this large price, the average person will never use
                        one in their daily lives. However if they were to, they could display 3D objects in their home using augmented reality, watch videos, play a variety of games,
                        and even use Skype to video call.

                        Microsoft's Mixed Reality platform offers many opportunities for education. It supports applications that show anatomy, tours of places throughout history and space,
                        chemisty, and more, all using Augmented Reality.

                        HoloLens assists with Medical Procedures by showing real-time visuals of the patient, instead of referring to another screen. With HoloLens that information can
                        basically be displayed right infront of you, as if it was part of your vision.

                        Out of the few hundered HoloLens apps on the Microsoft Store, quite a few of them are games. Some of them are simple and display some 3D object in your home, and 
                        some are more complex such as 2-player games, puzzles, and even virtual characters. Some pre-existing games even have Mixed Reality support, such as Minecraft.
                        I was surprised by how many games there are, and I think some of them look quite interesting and fun.

                        Mozilla released a version of FireFox compatible with HoloLens. It works like regular web browser and also showcases the capabilities of HoloLens to 
                        web developers.

                     Dogecoin was created by IBM software engineer Billy Markus and Adobe software engineer Jackson Palmer in December of 2013. 
                     Their goal was to create a digital currency that would appeal to a broader demographic than Bitcoin, as well as distance it 
                     from the controversial history of other cryptocurrencies.

                     Dogecoin features the Shiba Inu from the Doge meme. The cryptocurrency was started as joke / parody, but became very popular within a short amount of time.
                     It became so popular that only less than a month after Dogecoin started, the project was hacked and 21 million dogecoins were stolen, which amounted to around $12,000.<br>
                     A few months later in May of 2014, Dogecoin was infiltrated again and 280 million coins valued at $55,000 was stolen. The hacker even had access to every user's account
                     information, so they could have also obtained users' credit card information.

                     Dogecoin has a large online community. It appeals to more people and catches people's attention. <br>
                     The Dogecoin project is written with C++. It has an API which allows users to programatically get information such as the current block number and difficulty,
                     the balance in an address, or the amount received / given to a certain address.

                 <p>
                     I think Dogecoin will be around for quite some time. It might not last as long as other currencies like Bitcoin or Etheruem, but I think it has a wide enough appeal 
                     and community that it will be around for quite some time.

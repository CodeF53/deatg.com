  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.
The Snake speeds up when more Toad Head Cherries are collected, and upon reaching a specific score the game is beaten.
There are two versions:
Version 1.0 was the first to be released, and has a white background for the level, and does not have a hard mode.
Version 1.1 has mostly transparent Toad Faces as the background, and adds a Hard Mode as well as minor text fixes.This is a cropped version of the full image and has 1.5 billion pixels.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.
The Snake speeds up when more Toad Head Cherries are collected, and upon reaching a specific score the game is beaten.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.
The Snake speeds up when more Toad Head Cherries are collected, and upon reaching a specific score the game is beaten.
There are two versions:
Version 1.0 was the first to be released, and has a white background for the level, and does not have a hard mode.
Version 1.1 has mostly transparent Toad Faces as the background, and adds a Hard Mode as well as minor text fixes.This is a cropped version of the full image and has 1.5 billion pixels.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.
The Snake speeds up when more Toad Head Cherries are collected, and upon reaching a specific score the game is beaten.
There are two versions:
Version 1.0 was the first to be released, and has a white background for the level, and does not have a hard mode.
Version 1.1 has mostly transparent Toad Faces as the background, and adds a Hard Mode as well as minor text fixes.This is a cropped version of the full image and has 1.5 billion pixels.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.
The Snake speeds up when more Toad Head Cherries are collected, and upon reaching a specific score the game is beaten.
There are two versions:
Version 1.0 was the first to be released, and has a white background for the level, and does not have a hard mode.
Version 1.1 has mostly transparent Toad Faces as the background, and adds a Hard Mode as well as minor text fixes.This is a cropped version of the full image and has 1.5 billion pixels.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.
The Snake speeds up when more Toad Head Cherries are collected, and upon reaching a specific score the game is beaten.

Version 1.0 was the first to be released, and has a white background for the level, and does not have a hard mode.
Version 1.1 has mostly transparent Toad Faces as the background, and adds a Hard Mode as well as minor text  image, captured with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope,

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.
The Snake speeds up when more Toad Head Cherries are collected, and upon reaching a specific score the game is beaten.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.
The Snake speeds up when more Toad Head Cherries are collected, and upon reaching a specific score the game is beaten.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.
The Snake speeds up when more Toad Head Cherries are collected, and upon reaching a specific score the game is beaten.

  Gendler.Releasio Snakio is a mod of a JavaScript Snake clone. It was made by Ethan White. The Toad Snake will move very fast, and every frame there is a 50% chance of it moving a distance of two squares instead of one, making it possible to clip through the Toad Head Cherries. The game is lost when Toad Snake collides with a Toad Wall Block or a segment of itself.
The game includes a Hard Mode, in which Toad Snake will teleport to a random point on the level when he gets a Toad Head Cherry. The background music is the music from stage 1 of the NES game Contra.
